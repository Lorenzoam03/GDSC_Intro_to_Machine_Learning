# GDSC_Intro_to_Machine_Learning
##Overview
This Google Colab notebook provides an introductory machine learning project that predicts Tesla's stock closing prices using linear regression. It serves as an excellent educational resource for students getting started
with machine learning, covering the complete ML workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.

##Educational Value
🎯 Learning Objectives
Data Exploration: Students learn to examine real-world financial data using pandas operations like head(), info(), and describe()
Feature Selection: Understand how to choose relevant input features (High, Low, Open, Volume) to predict target variables (Close price)
Model Training: Hands-on experience with scikit-learn's LinearRegression implementation
Model Evaluation: Learn key regression metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) and their interpretation
Data Visualization: Create informative plots to understand data patterns and model performance
Train-Test Split: Practice proper model validation techniques

📈 Key Concepts Covered
Linear Regression Fundamentals: How multiple features combine to predict outcomes
Model Evaluation: Understanding overfitting/underfitting through train vs test performance
Financial Data Analysis: Working with time-series stock data
Visualization Techniques: Time series plots, scatter plots, and comparative analysis

🛠️ Technical Skills Developed
Python programming with data science libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
Data preprocessing and feature selection
Machine learning model implementation
Results interpretation and visualization
Google Colab environment navigation
